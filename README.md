# Health Insurance Coverage by Race and its Effects on Mental Health
# By Jacklyn O'Brien, Abigail Simanjuntak, Sidonia Summers, & Summer Johnson

This project was completed over the course of the Spring 2025 semester as a Capstone project to complete my Bachelor's Degree at the University of Vermont. We explored the effect of an individual's race and their health insurance plan on their overall mental health using data from the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We created several different statistical tools in R to investigate this question, including analysis of variance models, chi-square tests of independence, and several types of charts and graphs.
